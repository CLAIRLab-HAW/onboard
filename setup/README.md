# Husky
After installing the clearpath software stack (see [Clearpath Installation](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/installation/robot)), run this line in your user directory:

``
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CLAIRLab-HAW/husky-custom-setup/refs/heads/main/install-clearpath-custom-setup.sh && bash -e install-clearpath-custom-setup.sh
``

The installer is interactive and asks (each step `[j/N]`, or pass `-y` to accept all) before optional parts. One of them installs **`ur-dashboard.service`** — it starts the `ur_robot_driver` `dashboard_client` on boot (`power_on`/`brake_release`/`unlock_protective_stop`/`restart_safety`/`get_robot_mode`/`get_safety_mode`), which Clearpath does *not* bring up in the headless setup. The services land under `/a200_0553/manipulators/dashboard_client/*` and are consumed by the `ur_state_manager` package (repo [`ur-state-manager`](https://github.com/CLAIRLab-HAW/ur-state-manager)), which the installer can also clone, build and start on boot (`ur-state-manager.service`).
